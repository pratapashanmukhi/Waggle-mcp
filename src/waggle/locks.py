"""Cross-process file locking for SQLite database safety.

This module provides a ProcessLock context manager that uses platform-specific
file locking (fcntl.flock on Unix, msvcrt.locking on Windows) to ensure that
multi-statement transactions are protected across multiple Python processes.

Usage:
    with ProcessLock(db_path + ".lock"):
        # Multi-statement operations are protected here
        conn.execute("BEGIN IMMEDIATE")
        conn.execute("INSERT ...")
        conn.execute("UPDATE ...")
        conn.commit()

ProcessLock is NOT reentrant within the same thread/process. If you need
reentrant semantics, wrap ProcessLock usage with threading.RLock or similar.
